# Final Report

## Summary

We implemented a parallelized Poisson image editor with Jacobi method. It can compute results using seven extensions: NumPy, [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba), [Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi), single-thread c++, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA. In terms of performance, we have a detailed benchmarking result that the CUDA backend can achieve 31 to 42 times faster on GHC machines compared to the single-threaded c++ implementation. In terms of user-experience, we have a simple GUI to demonstrate the results interactively, released a standard [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/fpie/), and provide [a website](https://fpie.readthedocs.io/) for project documentation.

## Background

### Poisson Image Editing

[Poisson Image Editing](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall07/Papers/Perez03.pdf) is a technique that can blend two images together without artifacts. Given a source image and its corresponding mask, and a coordination on target image, this algorithm can always generate amazing result. The general idea is to keep most of gradient in source image, while matching the boundary of source image and target image pixels.

The gradient per pixel is computed by

$$\nabla(x,y)=4I(x,y)-I(x-1,y)-I(x,y-1)-I(x+1,y)-I(x,y+1)$$

After computing the gradient in source image, the algorithm tries to solve the following problem: given the gradient and the boundary value, calculate the approximate solution that meets the requirement, i.e., to keep target image's gradient as similar as the source image.

This process can be formulated as $(4-A)\vec{x}=\vec{b}$, where $A\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$, $\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^N$, $\vec{b}\in\mathbb{R}^N$, $N$ is the number of pixels in the mask, $A$ is a giant sparse matrix because each line of A only contains at most 4 non-zero value (neighborhood), $\vec{b}$ is the gradient from source image, and $\vec{x}$ is the result value.

$N$ is always a large number, i.e., greater than 50k, so the Gauss-Jordan Elimination cannot be directly applied here because of the high time complexity $O(N^3)$. People use [Jacobi Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method) to solve the problem. Thanks to the sparsity of matrix $A$, the overall time complexity is $O(MN)$ where $M$ is the number of iteration performed by Poisson image editing. The iterative equation is $\vec{x}' \leftarrow (A\vec{x}+\vec{b})/4$.

This project parallelizes Jacobi method to speed up the computation. To our best knowledge, there's no public project on GitHub that implements Poisson image editing with either OpenMP, or MPI, or CUDA. All of them can only handle a small size image workload ([link](https://github.com/PPPW/poisson-image-editing/issues/1)).

### PIE Solver

We implemented two different solvers: EquSolver and GridSolver.

EquSolver directly constructs the equations $(4-A)\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ by re-labeling the pixel, and use Jacobi method to get the solution via $\vec{x}' \leftarrow (A\vec{x}+\vec{b})/4$.

```python
""" EquSolver pseudocode."""

# pre-process
src, mask, tgt = read_images(src_name, mask_name, tgt_name)
A = build_A(mask)            # shape: (N, 4), dtype: int
X = build_X(tgt, mask)       # shape: (N, 3), dtype: float
B = build_B(src, mask, tgt)  # shape: (N, 3), dtype: float

# major computation, can be parallelized
for _ in range(n_iter):
    X = (X[A[:, 0]] + X[A[:, 1]] + X[A[:, 2]] + X[A[:, 3]] + B) / 4.0

# post-process
out = merge(tgt, X, mask)
write_image(out_name, out)
```

GridSolver uses the same Jacobi iteration, however, it keeps the 2D structure of the original image instead of re-labeling the pixel in the mask. It may take some advantage when the mask region covers all of the image, because in this case GridSolver can save 4 read instructions by directly calculating the neighborhood's coordinate. Meanwhile, it has a better locality of fetching related data.

```python
""" GridSolver pseudocode."""

# pre-process
src, mask, tgt = read_images(src_name, mask_name, tgt_name)
# mask: shape: (N, M), dtype: uint8
grad = calc_grad(src, mask, tgt)  # shape: (N, M, 3), dtype: float
x, y = np.nonzero(mask)  # find element-wise pixel index of mask array

# major computation, can be parallelized
for _ in range(n_iter):
    tgt[x, y] = (tgt[x - 1, y] + tgt[x, y - 1] + tgt[x, y + 1] + tgt[x + 1, y] + grad[x, y]) / 4.0

# post-process
write_image(out_name, tgt)
```

The bottleneck for both solvers is the for-loop and can be easily parallelized. The implementation detail and parallelization strategies will be discussed in the next section.


## Method

- APPROACH: Tell us how your implementation works. Your description should be sufficiently detailed to provide the course staff a basic understanding of your approach. Again, it might be very useful to include a figure here illustrating components of the system and/or their mapping to parallel hardware.
  - Break down the workload. Where are the dependencies in the program? How much parallelism is there? Is it data-parallel? Where is the locality? Is it amenable to SIMD execution?
  - Describe the technologies used. What language/APIs? What machines did you target?
  - Describe how you mapped the problem to your target parallel machine(s). IMPORTANT: How do the data structures and operations you described in part 2 map to machine concepts like cores and threads. (or warps, thread blocks, gangs, etc.)
  - Did you change the original serial algorithm to enable better mapping to a parallel machine?
  - If your project involved many iterations of optimization, please describe this process as well. What did you try that did not work? How did you arrive at your solution? The notes you have been writing throughout your project should be helpful here. Convince us you worked hard to arrive at a good solution.
  - If you started with an existing piece of code, please mention it (and where it came from) here.

## Experiments

- RESULTS: How successful were you at achieving your goals? We expect results sections to differ from project to project, but we expect your evaluation to be very thorough (your project evaluation is a great way to demonstrate you understood topics from this course). Here are a few ideas:
  - If your project was optimizing an algorithm, please define how you measured performance. Is it wall-clock time? Speedup? An application specific rate? (e.g., moves per second, images/sec)
  - Please also describe your experimental setup. What were the size of the inputs? How were requests generated?
  - Provide graphs of speedup or execute time. Please precisely define the configurations being compared. Is your baseline single-threaded CPU code? It is an optimized parallel implementation for a single CPU?
  - Recall the importance of problem size. Is it important to report results for different problem sizes for your project? Do different workloads exhibit different execution behavior?
  - **IMPORTANT:** What limited your speedup? Is it a lack of parallelism? (dependencies) Communication or synchronization overhead? Data transfer (memory-bound or bus transfer bound). Poor SIMD utilization due to divergence? As you try and answer these questions, we strongly prefer that you provide data and measurements to support your conclusions. If you are merely speculating, please state this explicitly. Performing a solid analysis of your implementation is a good way to pick up credit even if your optimization efforts did not yield the performance you were hoping for.
  - Deeper analysis: Can you break execution time of your algorithm into a number of distinct components. What percentage of time is spent in each region? Where is there room to improve?
  - Was your choice of machine target sound? (If you chose a GPU, would a CPU have been a better choice? Or vice versa.)

If the GridSolver's parameter `grid_x` and `grid_y` is carefully tuned, it can always perform better than EquSolver with different backend configuration.
